This is a project worked on by Sai Santosh Kumar Ganti, Abhishek Rai Sharma, Mohit, and Vijay Karigowadara as part of BU CAS CS 542. 

Below are the instructions on how to run the code and see the results. 

The data for this project is provided by Kaggle. The data itself is so big that it's not possible to provide the code over GitHub or zip file. So, we will make use of Kaggle environment and the kernels provided by them. Kaggle kernels are just iPython notebook running on a cloud python environment provided by Kaggle. 

We have provided the code in the form of iPython notebook. Please download the notebook provided and to run the code in the notebook please set up an account on Kaggle and upload this notebook in a kernel over at Kaggle. 

We will in this repository provide our report and iPython Notebook for reference.
